# Unnamed Trivia Project

Description:

Just your simple untitled trivia game that features questions related to computer science and technology.

How to Play:
* Users answer up to 10 random computer science and technology questions
* Simply load the web page and select the most correct answer displayed below the question.
* All questions are multiple choice
* Correct answers add 10 points to your score. Incorrect answers subtract 5 points. (So give it your best guess!)

List of Technologies Used:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Open Trivia db API

Challenges:
* DOM manipulation can be a little bit tricky. The added complexity of working with an API also ate up more time to track down bugs in how I'd implemented the game design.

Additional Enhancements:
* I'd like to add a game modal box that ask the player if they'd like to play a new game after answering all the questions. 
* I'd like to add a drop down so the player can select the number of questions and have that displayed
* Add game play countdown timer
